## Introduction

## Credits and sponsorship

This library was inspired by the following projects:

- [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts)
- [zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)
- [zio-schema](https://github.com/zio/zio-schema)

A huge thanks to my sponsors who made the development of `@fp-ts/schema` possible.

If you also want to **become a sponsor** to ensure this library continues to improve and receive maintenance, check out my [GitHub Sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/gcanti?o=sd&sc=t)
